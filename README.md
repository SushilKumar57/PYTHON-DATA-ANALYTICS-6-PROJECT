# PYTHON DATA ANALYTICS 6 PROJECT BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Ms. Nandini Jalan (Ex-Intern at GOOGLE). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>INTRO TO PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON
<li>INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY AND PANDAS
<li>FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN DATA ANALYTICS
<li>HANDS ON PROJECT
  <br>And much more...</br>
<br>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
